# About Me
---
My name is Hayden Haller, and I'm a freshmen at Mizzou this year.
My major is IT, as you might have guessed.
My interests are in Software Engineering/Programming, and Digital Media, but I'm also really interested in History and Music.

Below is a picture of me, because I know you were curious.

I'm still not _totally_ sure what I wanna do for these other 4 pages, so bear with me because some of these may be outta left field.
