# Coding in Non-English Languages
---
Earlier this morning, when I was in the shower I had the thought 'I wonder what programming is like for non-english speaking countries when many major languages use english based syntax and keywords?' and I figured I would use my answer for that as a page in this repository

Upon doing a little research, I found that there are a pretty significant number of languages that are based in [languages other than english](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-English-based_programming_languages).
In the grand scheme of things however, the prevalence of non-english based programming languages is pretty low compared to the prevalence of ones who's syntax is based on english.

Basically, from what i've gathered, it's still not a very inclusive field.
Most non-english speakers who code use the standard english syntax and key words, however their object and method names can be in whatever the language of the coder is.

At the end of the day, code is just instructions for a machine, and with a little intuition into how computer code works most code can be followed regardless of language.
One can certainly see how having the understanding of keywords from their use in english would give a programmer a little edge in terms of their ability to learn and understand major languages, however.
