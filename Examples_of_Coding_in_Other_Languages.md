 # Examples of Code in Non-English Languages
---
I thought this example of Python in chinese was interesting, especially given how Chinese uses a character system instead of a latin script like english and many western languages.

Another interesting example, this is from Qalb, and Arabic based programming language.
I thought this one was interesting because Arabic has the whatever functions as the print method after the string that is printed instead of before it.
This is more than likely because Arabic does not share the Subject-Verb-Object sentence structure English has.
