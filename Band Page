# Sliced Bread: The band
---
So my interest in music that I mentioned earlier is through the outlet of the band I play in: Sliced Bread.
The closest genre I can give you is indie/alt rock, which encompasses a lot of things but so do we. 

We have only have one single out at the moment, but if you want to hear what we've done so far you can find us on all streaming services, like [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4KQl4ZFqc9JQOlGmv76Xmv?si=qHuCCfqDTLWBg_KofFX1uw) for example.

I play bass guitar for Sliced Bread, which was something I never expected to have skill in. 
I wasn't honestly all that interested in music until a couple years ago, but because they were all close friends of mine they just asked me if I wanted to pick up bass and play with them.
So naturally, that's exactly what I did a little over a year ago and now here we are.
